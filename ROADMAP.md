## Future Enhancements

### High Priority - Complex Algorithmic Tools

*Tools that implement complex algorithms, are error-prone when done manually, or require specialized domain knowledge. These provide the most value by offloading genuinely difficult tasks.*

- [ ] **IP calculation tool** - IPv4/IPv6 subnet calculations, CIDR operations, network analysis
- [ ] **Crypto tool** - Password hashing, verification, and various hash algorithms
- [ ] **Regex tool** - Pattern testing, validation, debugging

### Medium Priority - Specialized Tools

*Tools that extend existing functionality or provide specialized capabilities. Useful but not as algorithmically complex as high-priority tools.*

- [ ] **Text similarity tool** - Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching, string comparison
- [ ] Additional barcode formats (UPC, Code 128, etc.)
- [ ] More international standards (SWIFT codes, etc.)

### Low Priority - Infrastructure & Simple Tools

*Tools that are mostly convenience features, simple string manipulation, or infrastructure improvements. These could often be handled directly by AI assistants.*

- [ ] Enhanced date/time utilities and formatting
- [ ] Random data generation (names, addresses, realistic test data)
- [ ] Data validation and sanitization tools
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large-scale generation
- [ ] Enhanced MCP protocol features
- [ ] Plugin architecture for custom tools
