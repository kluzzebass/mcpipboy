When creating cobra commands, always make sure that

- examples are included for anything but the simplest commands.
- you use the `Examples` property for examples.
- you don't include examples in the `Long` property.
- command functions are named after the entire command path, so that the command `validate schema` becomes `validateSchema()`.
